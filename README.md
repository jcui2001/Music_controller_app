# Music_controller_app
Shared music controller interface built in React JS and Django.

This application is based off of TechWithTim's project: https://github.com/techwithtim/Music-Controller-Web-App-Tutorial

Following Tech with Tim's YouTube tutorial while adding supplementary features.

This project demonstrates my ability to build full-stack applications, develop RESTful API's, host and deploy, and technical experience in the stack involved.
